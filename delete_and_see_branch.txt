see:
local: git branch
remote: git branch --remote
both: git branch --all

delete:
local:
git branch --delete branch_name
or git branch -D branch_name(delete even if it is not merged)

remote:
git push --delete origin branch_name
or git push origin :branch_name

I think push maybe mean accessing to remote and origin branch_name mean that remote folder: origin/branch_name.
":" mean minus.
"--" mean option command.
* when correcting remote, not "branch" but "push"
